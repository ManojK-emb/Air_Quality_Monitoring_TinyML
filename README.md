# Air_Quality_Monitoring_TinyML

## Introduction

Air pollution has become a persistent global challenge, influencing public health, environmental stability, and sustainable development across urban and industrial regions. Conventional air quality monitoring solutions are largely based on cloud-centric architectures, where sensed data are continuously transmitted to remote servers for storage and analysis. While effective for large-scale analytics, these approaches introduce critical limitations such as increased energy consumption, network latency, privacy risks, and reduced reliability in remote or resource-constrained environments. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a real-time air quality measurement and monitoring framework built on Edge Artificial Intelligence using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).
The proposed system integrates heterogeneous environmental sensors capable of measuring gaseous pollutants, particulate matter, temperature, and humidity, enabling continuous and localized data acquisition. Instead of relying on cloud computation, all signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and inference operations are executed directly on a low-power embedded IoT device. This edge-based processing significantly reduces communication overhead, ensures rapid response, and improves data confidentiality. Several lightweight machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, compact Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, are implemented and evaluated under identical experimental conditions to assess their feasibility for embedded deployment.
A carefully optimized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is selected as the primary inference engine due to its favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The model is tailored to meet stringent constraints on memory footprint, execution latency, and power consumption required by TinyML platforms. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MLP-based model achieves an average classification accuracy of approximately ninety-five percent, with inference latency below ten milliseconds and total memory usage under fifty kilobytes on the target hardware. Compared with conventional machine learning approaches, the system exhibits superior energy efficiency and robustness against environmental variability. 


## Objective

The primary objective of this work is to design and develop a real-time air quality monitoring system that leverages Tiny Machine Learning and Edge Artificial Intelligence to overcome the limitations of traditional cloud-dependent solutions. The system aims to provide accurate, low-latency, and energy-efficient air quality assessment using a low-power embedded IoT platform, making it suitable for continuous operation in diverse environmental conditions. By executing data processing and inference directly at the edge, the proposed framework seeks to reduce communication overhead, improve responsiveness, and enhance data privacy.
One of the key objectives is to integrate heterogeneous environmental sensors capable of measuring critical air quality parameters, including gaseous pollutants, particulate matter, temperature, and humidity. Accurate sensor integration is essential to ensure reliable data acquisition under varying environmental conditions. The system is designed to continuously collect real-time data while maintaining stability and consistency, thereby enabling meaningful analysis and classification of air quality levels. This objective supports the creation of a comprehensive sensing framework that reflects real-world environmental dynamics.
Another important objective is to implement and evaluate multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms that are suitable for deployment on resource-constrained embedded platforms. These algorithms include Decision Tree, compact Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. By evaluating these models under identical experimental conditions, the study aims to identify their comparative strengths and limitations in terms of accuracy, inference speed, memory usage, and power consumption. This systematic comparison provides insights into the feasibility of different algorithms for TinyML-based environmental monitoring applications.
A central objective of the proposed work is the optimization of a Multi-Layer Perceptron model for edge deployment. The MLP is carefully designed to achieve high classification accuracy while adhering to strict constraints on memory footprint, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Model optimization techniques such as parameter reduction, efficient feature selection, and architecture tuning are employed to ensure compatibility with low-power microcontrollers. Achieving an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency is a critical goal of this research.
The project also aims to minimize inference latency to enable real-time air quality assessment and timely alert generation. Fast local inference is essential for applications where immediate action is required, such as pollution threshold violations or hazardous environmental conditions. By executing all preprocessing and inference tasks locally, the system seeks to achieve millisecond-level response times, thereby enhancing reliability and operational effectiveness compared to cloud-based alternatives.
Another objective is to enhance system scalability and robustness. The proposed framework is designed to operate independently at each sensing node while optionally supporting cloud-based visualization and data aggregation. This hybrid approach ensures that the system remains functional even in the absence of continuous internet connectivity. Robustness against environmental variability and sensor noise is also a key consideration, ensuring consistent performance across different deployment scenarios.
Finally, the work aims to demonstrate the practical applicability of TinyML-based edge intelligence for smart city infrastructure, industrial pollution monitoring, and decentralized environmental surveillance. By validating the system through experimental evaluation and performance analysis, the study seeks to establish TinyML as a viable and sustainable solution for next-generation air quality monitoring systems that prioritize efficiency, responsiveness, and accessibility.

This capability is particularly important for applications requiring timely intervention, such as industrial safety monitoring and urban pollution control.
To enhance scalability and usability, the system incorporates optional IoT connectivity for remote visualization and data aggregation. While core intelligence operates independently at the edge, summarized air quality information can be transmitted to cloud platforms or user interfaces for monitoring and analysis. This hybrid architecture ensures continuous operation even during network outages while supporting centralized oversight when connectivity is available.
